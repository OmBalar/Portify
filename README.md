# Portify
Portify is a website where users can upload their projects and it will create a nicely formatted portfolio so people can use it for applications and since everyone will have the same portfolio styling, recruiters can focus on the projects instead of how the portfolio looks.

I have not deployed the website yet. To look at the website, simply clone the repo and run the frontend using 'npm start' and run the backend using 'npm run dev'. The database features will not be available without the data since it isn't deployed.
